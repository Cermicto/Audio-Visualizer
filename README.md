Web Audio API Visualizer Using HTML Elements

Plays on a web server, local or otherwise. Throws a CORS notification if trying to play from local file.

The music was generated by AI at Suno.com so it is free to use non-commercially.

## Visualizer

Gets frequency data (analyser.getByteFrequencyData(dataArray)) from an AudioContext of the Web Audio API connected to an MP3 file and applies the values to CSS attributes of HTML elements using an animate() function recursively calling itself from requestAnimationFrame(animate) to update the styles. Colors and sizes of two independent arrays of HTML elements are updated. I made it to see how much different browsers could handle when dealing with updating HTML elements opposed to updating a canvas element. It definitely takes more horsepower to update HTML elements but I adjusted it to be visually pleasing and efficient enough to run even on low-powered phones or tablets. It looks great in portrait mode on a phone's browser and on a desktop browser but is generally pleasing to the eye overall.
